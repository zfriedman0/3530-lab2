Description: 
    The proxy server (server.c/pserver) first connects to the client,
    and then connects to the web server that hosts the website at whatever
    URL the user specifies using the client program.

    The client (client.c/client) is used to connect to the proxy server and 
    send a URL to be fetched by the proxy.

Usage:
    - Compile the client code:              gcc -o client client.c
    - Compile the server code:              gcc -o pserver server.c
    - First, execute the server program:    ./pserver <port number>
    - Then, execute the client program:     ./client <port number>
    - When prompted, enter a URL like www.google.com. The client program
      will output whatever is sent back to the proxy.
